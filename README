PCP github created. 

The C code for new directional PCP hamiltonian was created in 2021 and was used last in Nov 2021. That code set is uploaded here. 
This has siz C codes. The main code is main.pcp.

Few additional files are added. These are for running mutiple runs and for data analysis. The script of multiple runs are bash scripts. The data analysis scriot is in Matlab.

For running multiple simulations, the mainpcpmut.c code is compiled with different parameter values and then run.
The parameter values are given in a csv file called 'input'. This file is also provided.

A sample output file is also provided for referance.

This C code includes mutations in the model. The mutated cells are not able to interact with the neighbouring cells and the energy term for this interaction, h1 = 0 for mutated cells.

Changes made:

mainpcp_m1_mut.c:
Code now contains an additional parameter called percentMutated and its value will be given in the input file by the use. It represents percent of cells mutated in the total cells.
logfile now stores data about percentMutated in each simulation.
Code is edited to allow mcmcMutated function to take this percentMutated as a paraemeter.

mcmcmut_m1.c:
Code now stores an array of size total number of cells which stores either one or zero as each element. 1 implies cell is normal and zero implies it is mutated.
During calculation of h1 for a selected cell number, the whole term is multiplied with either 1 or 0 depending on its value in the above array to check whether a cell is mutated or not. In this way h1 is zero if the cell is mutated and h1 calculation is unaffected if the cell is normal.
